Assumptions:

1. Dataset contains columns: Order_ID, Order_Date, Ship_Mode, Ship_City, Ship_State, Ship_Region, Ship_Country, Market, Sales.

Basic Data Cleaning:

Remove duplicates
SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM dataset;

Handle missing values
SELECT 
  Order_ID,
  Order_Date,
  COALESCE(Ship_Mode, 'Unknown') AS Ship_Mode,
  COALESCE(Ship_City, 'Unknown') AS Ship_City,
  COALESCE(Ship_State, 'Unknown') AS Ship_State,
  COALESCE(Ship_Region, 'Unknown') AS Ship_Region,
  COALESCE(Ship_Country, 'Unknown') AS Ship_Country,
  COALESCE(Market, 'Unknown') AS Market,
  Sales
FROM dataset;


Segmentation by Country, Region, Market:


Country-wise sales
SELECT 
  Ship_Country,
  SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM dataset
GROUP BY Ship_Country;

Region-wise sales
SELECT 
  Ship_Region,
  SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM dataset
GROUP BY Ship_Region;

Market-wise sales
SELECT 
  Market,
  SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM dataset
GROUP BY Market;


Visualization: Percentage of Shipping based on Ship Mode


Ship mode percentage
SELECT 
  Ship_Mode,
  COUNT(*) AS Total_Orders,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dataset) * 100, 2) AS Percentage
FROM dataset
GROUP BY Ship_Mode;


Sales over City, States, Region, and Market:


City-wise sales
SELECT 
  Ship_City,
  SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM dataset
GROUP BY Ship_City;

State-wise sales
SELECT 
  Ship_State,
  SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM dataset
GROUP BY Ship_State;

Region-wise sales (already calculated above)

 Market-wise sales (already calculated above)


Tables for Visualizations:


Country-wise sales table
CREATE TABLE Country_Sales (
  Country VARCHAR(50),
  Total_Sales DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

Region-wise sales table
CREATE TABLE Region_Sales (
  Region VARCHAR(50),
  Total_Sales DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

Market-wise sales table
CREATE TABLE Market_Sales (
  Market VARCHAR(50),
  Total_Sales DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

Ship mode percentage table
CREATE TABLE Ship_Mode_Percentage (
  Ship_Mode VARCHAR(50),
  Total_Orders INT,
  Percentage DECIMAL(5, 2)
);

City-wise sales table
CREATE TABLE City_Sales (
  City VARCHAR(50),
  Total_Sales DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- State-wise sales table
CREATE TABLE State_Sales (
  State VARCHAR(50),
  Total_Sales DECIMAL(10, 2)
);


Data Visualization Tools:

Use tools like Tableau, Power BI, or D3.js to create interactive visualizations.
